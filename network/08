First we need to find the A records for the domain, so we run `dig any slash16.org`

```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
slash16.org.            59      IN      A       13.225.84.89
slash16.org.            59      IN      A       13.225.84.84
slash16.org.            59      IN      A       13.225.84.228
slash16.org.            59      IN      A       13.225.84.69
```

We can then run whois on one of the IP Addresses: `whois 13.225.84.69`

And we can see lots of mentions of Amazon in the output from whois, therefore we can assume the provider of slash16.org is AWS.
